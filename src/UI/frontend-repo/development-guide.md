# Baseball Analytics System Development Guide

## âœ“ Project Implementation Complete
All major task sections (A-F) have been successfully completed as of the latest update. The remaining checklist serves as a reference for future maintenance and additions to the system.

## Build Rules and Development Standards

### 1. Verification Rules
- Before creating any new file or component:
  1. Search the entire codebase for similar implementations
  2. Check all related directories for existing files
  3. Run grep searches for similar class/function names
  4. Verify the feature doesn't exist in a different form

### 2. Implementation Rules
- Complete tasks in atomic units
- Each task must be 100% complete before moving to the next
- All implementations must include:
  - Full TypeScript type coverage
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Error handling
  - Documentation
  - Linting compliance

### 3. Testing Standards
- All new code must have:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests where applicable
  - E2E tests for user-facing features
  - 90%+ test coverage
  - Performance benchmarks where relevant

### 4. Code Quality Rules
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Zero ESLint warnings
- Consistent code formatting
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear logging
- Performance optimization

### 5. Documentation Requirements
- Code documentation
- Test documentation
- Usage examples
- Type definitions
- Error handling documentation

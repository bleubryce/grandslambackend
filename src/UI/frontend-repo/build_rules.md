- Must follow project workflow
- Must maintain clean history

## Workflow Rules

### 1. Continuous Development
- Work should proceed continuously through all tasks
- Follow task dependencies and sequential order
- Update progress tracker as tasks complete
- Do not wait for intermediate review
- Final review will be conducted after all tasks are complete

### 2. Task Completion Flow
- Complete each task fully before moving to next
- Follow all quality and testing requirements
- Update documentation and progress tracking
- Proceed immediately to next task
- No intermediate check-ins required

### 3. Final Review Process
- All tasks must be completed
- All tests must pass
- All documentation must be current
- Full system verification will be done at end
- No partial reviews needed during development

## Test Task Management Rules

### 1. Test Implementation Order
- Component tests must be implemented in sequence
- Each component must have complete test coverage before moving to next
- E2E tests must follow component test completion
- Integration tests must be implemented last

### 2. Test Completion Criteria
For any test task to be considered complete:
- All test cases must be implemented
- Tests must achieve minimum 80% coverage
- Tests must pass consistently
- Test documentation must be updated
- No known bugs or issues remain

### 3. Test Documentation Requirements
Each test implementation must include:
- Test case descriptions
- Coverage reports
- Setup instructions
- Mock data documentation
- Error scenario handling

### 4. Test Automation Rules
- Tests must be automated in CI/CD pipeline
- Tests must run on every PR
- Failed tests must block merges
- Test results must be logged
- Coverage reports must be generated

### 5. Progress Synchronization
- tasks.md must be updated after each test completion
- progress_tracker.md must reflect current test status
- todo.md must be updated to show completed items
- All documents must remain in sync
- No manual status tracking allowed

## Development Environment Rules

### 1. Standard Development Setup
- Use npm for package management
- Follow TypeScript configuration
- Maintain consistent directory structure
- Use Jest and Testing Library for tests
- Follow component naming conventions (PascalCase)

### 2. Testing Environment
- Run tests using npm test commands
- Maintain test coverage requirements (80% minimum)
- Keep test files alongside components
- Follow Testing Library best practices
- Use consistent naming patterns for test files

### 3. Component Development Flow
1. Start development environment:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm test
   
   # Run specific component tests
   npm test ComponentName
   
   # Run tests with coverage
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```
3. Update progress tracker after successful tests
4. Commit only when all tests pass
5. Maintain test coverage requirements

### 4. Database Operations
- Use proper database connection strings
- Follow migration procedures
- Maintain test database separately
- Follow data seeding procedures
- Handle database versioning

### 5. Caching Operations
- Implement proper cache strategies
- Follow cache invalidation rules
- Monitor cache performance
- Handle cache versioning

## Development Environment Rules

### 1. Docker-Based Development
- All development must use containerized environment
- Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development
- Use dedicated test service for running tests
- Maintain separate databases for development and testing
- Follow container health checks before operations

### 2. Testing Environment
- Run all tests within test container
- Use isolated test database
- Execute tests using `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up test`
- Ensure all services are healthy before running tests
- Maintain test data isolation

### 3. Component Development Flow
1. Start development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up app
   ```
2. Run tests in isolation:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up test
   ```
3. Update progress tracker after successful tests
4. Commit only when all tests pass
5. Maintain test coverage requirements

### 4. Database Operations
- Use containerized PostgreSQL
- Run migrations through Docker
- Maintain separate test database
- Follow data seeding procedures
- Handle database versioning

### 5. Caching Operations
- Use containerized Redis
- Follow cache invalidation rules
- Maintain separate test cache
- Monitor cache performance
